  This application note shows how to use the CAN bus for OBD-II to retrieve engine RPM
description: |
  This application demonstrates how to connect the Particle Tracker One to a vehicleâ€™s CAN bus using the OBD-II (J1962) interface to retrieve engine RPM and other data.

  Key Features:
  - Configure CAN bus parameters and request data such as engine RPM from the vehicle.
  - Add vehicle data to location publishes.
  - Aggregate frequently changing data and upload metrics (minimum, average, and maximum) alongside location data.
  - Dynamically adjust the location publish rate based on conditions (e.g., when the engine is running above idle).

  This example uses the Particle CAN library [can-mcp25x](https://github.com/particle-iot/can-mcp25x) and includes a CAN bus simulator for easier testing.
